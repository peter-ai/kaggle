# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The primary goal of this project as stated by Kaggle is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

In addition to developing a high performing model, here we look into model comparison, performance and explainability. We seek to understand *why* the selected model performs highly and what features it deems as important in predicting the outcome for an individual on the sinking ship.
