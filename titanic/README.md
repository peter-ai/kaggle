# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The primary goal of this project as stated by Kaggle is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

We seek to develop a highly performant model, but restrict ourselves to some of the more basic/standard data transformations and only employ classical machine learning algorithms in the analysis. 

The model achieves a ~78% accuracy score on the testing data when submitted to Kaggle, so ~25th percentile.
